         <p class="about-both-info">I'm Maddi, a physics nerd and nature lover with a passion for nature, people, and exploration. Motivated by an urge to explore, foster meaningful relationships and experience the diversity that different communities across the world have to offer, I left home in January 2021 to volunteer across 6 countries. Through exchange opportunities in farms, hostels and educational communities, I strive to make a long lasting impact in both my own life and of the people I meet along the way. In some ways, I hope these experiences will help shape my cultural knowledge, environmental awareness, and overall willingness to face the unknown throughout life. In exchange, I'm excited to share my passion with those who are in need of some additional hands. I believe that human connection and understanding is one of the most important parts of life, and I seek to share experiences and differences with others far from home.
